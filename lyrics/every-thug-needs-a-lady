you know its dark here 
you know that im scared too
for some reason right now
of everything but you
and right now your all that i recognise

you know i came here
when i needed your soft voice 
i needed to hear something
that sounded like an answer 
now i wait here 
and sometimes i get one

an its nothing ill forget, when the moon gets tired
you have stuck to me every day
balieve in what i am, 'cos its all that i have today
an tomorrow who knows where well be

from here i can hardly see a thing
but i will follow anyone to you
for now, for ever 
for on and on and on

you know it starts here
outside waiting in the cold
kiss me once in the snow 
i hope it never gets old
and i will promise you
i can make it warmer next year

you know i came here, 
because i needed your soft voice
i needed to feel something
that sounded like an answer
now i stay here
and every day i get one

an its nothing ill forget
when the moon gets tired
you have stuck to me every day
beleive in what i am because its all that i have today
and tomorrow who knows where well be

from here i can hardly see a thing
but i will follow anyone who leads me to you
for now, for ever, for on and on and on

so go plug in your electric blanket
we can stay here til our southern summer wedding day
go plug in your electric blanket
we can stay here
