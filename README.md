# Key trainer
This is a really simple tool to help me get used to a new keyboard layout

It is really simple and minimal becase i am writing it on the new keyboard and its still pretty painful at the moment

## Usage 
The default behaviour is to open in single character mode

`-w` single word mode\
`-s` special character mode\
`-c [string]` word mode but only words containing the substring\
`-p` paragraph mode: this works more or less like a standard typing spped test, just without the speed tracking

## ./typing-test
this is the version that all the uodates will be comming in

 - [ ] add cpm wpm timers/displays
 - [x] add contains mode
 - [x] add a mode where you set the total number of words and you type til they are done
 - [ ] capture ctrl+c and display a closing screen with stats
